- Chapter 4: Creation
   - The knowledge in human brains and the knowledge in biological adaptations are both created by _evolution_ in the broad sense: the variation of existing information, alternating with selection. In the case of human knowledge, the variation is by conjecture, and the selection is by criticism and experiment. In the biosphere, the variation consists of mutations (random changes) in genes, and natural selection favours the variants that most improve the ability of their organisms to reproduce, thus causing those variant genes to spread through the population.
   - Creationism:
      - many biological adaptations have distinctly suboptimal features.
      - There are even examples of _non_-functional design. For instance, most animals have a gene for synthesizing vitamin C, but in primates, including humans, though that gene is recognizably present, it is faulty: it does not do anything.
      - ‘the problem of suffering’ or ‘the problem of evil’, and is frequently used as an argument against the existence of God.
      - The central flaw of creationism – that its account of how the knowledge in adaptations could possibly be created is either missing, supernatural or illogical – is also the central flaw of pre-Enlightenment, authoritative conceptions of _human_ knowledge.
